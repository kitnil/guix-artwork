#+TITLE: GuixSD website

The GuixSD website available at https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/ is
a static website built with [[https://haunt.dthompson.us/][Haunt]].  This directory contains the source
files of the website.


* Development environment

This website is developed using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/download/][GNU Guix]] package manager. Run the
following command to install all the software needed to build the
website:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ guix package -i git glibc-locales gnutls guile guile-json guile-syntax-highlight guix haunt
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Running the website

To try out the website locally while you work on it, run the following
commands:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd path/to/guix-artwork/website
$ GUIX_WEB_SITE_LOCAL=yes haunt build
$ haunt serve
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, visit http://localhost:8080/guix.html in a web browser.

You can stop the server pressing ~Ctrl + C~ twice.

To build the website for guix.info set the environment variable
=GUIX_WEB_SITE_INFO= first.

* Deploying

Like the pages of many GNU websites, this website is managed through
Savannah CVS.  To deploy the website it should be copied to the CVS
tree and then checked in.  The website will be updated automatically
once the files have been checked into CVS.
