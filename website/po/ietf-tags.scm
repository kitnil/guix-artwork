;;; This file contains an association list for each translation from
;;; the locale to an IETF language tag to be used in the URL path of
;;; translated pages.  The language tag results from the translation
;;; team’s language code from
;;; <https://translationproject.org/team/index.html>.  The underscore
;;; in the team’s code is replaced by a hyphen.  For example, az would
;;; be used for the Azerbaijani language (not az-Latn) and zh-CN would
;;; be used for mainland Chinese (not zh-Hans-CN).
