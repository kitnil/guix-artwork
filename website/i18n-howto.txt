With sexp-xgettext, arbitrary s-expressions can be marked for
translation (not only strings like with normal xgettext).

S-expressions can be marked with G_ (simple marking for translation),
N_ (“complex” marking with different forms depending on number like
ngettext), C_ (“complex” marking distinguished from other markings by
a msgctxt like pgettext) or NC_ (mix of both).

Marking a string for translation behaves like normal gettext.  Marking
a parenthesized expression (i.e. a list or procedure call) extracts
each string from the parenthesized expression.  If a symbol, keyword
or other parenthesized expression occurs between the strings, it is
extracted as an XML element.  Expressions before or after all strings
are not extracted.  If strings from a parenthesized sub-expression
shall be extracted too, the sub-expression must again be marked with
G_ unless it is the only sub-expression or it follows a quote,
unquote, quasiquote or unquote-splicing.  The order of XML elements
can be changed in the translation to produce a different ordering
inside a parenthesized expression.  If a string shall not be extracted
from a marked expression, it must be wrapped, for example by a call to
the identity procedure.  Be careful when marking non-SHTML content
such as procedure calls for translation: Additional strings will be
inserted between non-string elements.

Known issues:

* Line numbers are sometimes off.

* Some less important other TODOs in the comments.

=====

The following commands are an example of the translation for locale
de_DE.  Adapt as necessary.  We assume the software requirements
mentioned in the README are installed.

To create a pot file:

guile scripts/sexp-xgettext.scm -f po/POTFILES \
                                -o po/guix-website.pot \
                                --from-code=UTF-8 \
                                --copyright-holder="Ludovic Courtès" \
                                --package-name="guix-website" \
                                --msgid-bugs-address="ludo@gnu.org" \
                                --keyword=G_ \
                                --keyword=N_:1,2 \
                                --keyword=C_:1c,2 \
                                --keyword=NC_:1c,2,3

To create a po file from a pot file, do the usual:

cd po
msginit -l de --no-translator

To merge an existing po file with a new pot file:

cd po
msgmerge -U de.po guix-website.pot

To update mo files:

mkdir -p de/LC_MESSAGES
cd po
msgfmt de.po
cd ..
mv po/messages.mo de/LC_MESSAGES/guix-website.mo

To build all languages:

guix build -f .guix.scm

To test the de_DE translation:

guix environment --ad-hoc haunt
LC_ALL=de_DE.utf8 \
 GUILE_LOAD_PATH=$(guix build guile-syntax-highlight)/share/guile/site/2.2:$GUILE_LOAD_PATH \
 GUIX_WEB_SITE_LOCAL=yes \
 haunt build
GUILE_LOAD_PATH=$(guix build guile-syntax-highlight)/share/guile/site/2.2:$GUILE_LOAD_PATH \
 haunt serve

For checking for errors / debugging newly marked files you can try:

GUILE_LOAD_PATH=.:$(guix build haunt)/share/guile/site/2.2:\
$(guix build guile-syntax-highlight)/share/guile/site/2.2:$GUILE_LOAD_PATH \
 guile apps/base/templates/about.scm   # an example for debugging about.scm
